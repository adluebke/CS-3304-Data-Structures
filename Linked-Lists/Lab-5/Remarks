"The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce linked list concepts in C++.
Specifically, the lab to repeat the "sequence" lab except to use a linked list.
Note that there is no upper bound on the size of the sequence. You need to use author's 
header file and test file: sequence3.h and sequence_exam3.cpp."

As stated above, the header file was provided as well as the test file. Also, they gave me the
header and implementation files for the node class. Everything else was done by me. Other than that, 
it is the same concept as Labs 3 and 4; only we utilize a linked list instead.
