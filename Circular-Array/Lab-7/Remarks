"The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce linear data structure implementations in C++.
Specifically, the lab is to construct a C++ implementation of a static deque class.
The header file that we will use is deque.h."

As noted above, only the deque.h file was provided to me. The implmentation file and the main
file were written by me. However, we had to use a .template file to implement the deque class.
