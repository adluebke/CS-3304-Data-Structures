"The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce container class concepts in C++.  
Specifically, the lab is to implement the sequence class from chapter 3.  
You should use the author's header file and the author's test program (sequence_exam.cpp)."

A sequence being a structure that contains a cursor which tracks traversal through the array. It
also has functions that allow the user to insert an element before the cursor and after it; as well as
other typical functions like remove and next().
