"The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce container class concepts in C++.
Specifically, the lab to repeat the lab from last week except to use a dynamic array.
Note that there is no upper bound on the size of the sequence. You need to use the 
author's files sequence2.h and sequence_exam2.cpp"

Please refer to the remarks file under "Lab 3" for further elaboration on what a sequence is.
The key difference for this lab being the use of pointers to manually resize an array if the
used spaces exceed the max capacity of the array.
