"The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce tree implementations in C++.
Specifically, the lab is to do problem #8 on page 538 of the text."

pg. 538, problem #8:

"Write a function that takes a binary search tree as input and produces a linked list of the entries,
with the entries sorted (smallest entries at the front of the list and largest entries at the back)."

The bst.h and bst.template files were written for us on this lab. We just needed to alter them and create
a main file that met the criteria.
